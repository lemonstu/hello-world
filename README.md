# hello-world
My first Fithub
Hi, my name is Isaac and I honestly have no idea what to expect, altough it feels a bit exciting.
I truly hope to able to join the programmers community by next year and actually understand what how and what programmers think.
I'm 41 with, you guessed it, a midlife crisis hoping for a career change - let's see how it goes

Cheers
